# Convolutional LSTM For Traffic Prediction

Created by Ryan, Alvaro, Arthur, and Henrique

## Training/evaluation/prediction

Code was created entirely using Google Colab Pro with GPU and High-RAM. We have transitioned it into a Jupyter Notebook for local running for the purposes of submitting this report. Expect to run out of memory if working with limited RAM. H5 Files included in this repository and training parameters are more limited than during development due to GitHub storage constraints that were not an issue using a Google Drive/Google Colab Pro stack.
